        <h3>A laptop computer, sometimes called a notebook computer by manufacturers, is a battery- or AC-powered personal computer generally smaller than a briefcase that can easily be transported and conveniently
             used in temporary spaces such as on airplanes, in libraries, temporary offices, and at meetings.</h3>
